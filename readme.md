This is a command line program designed to work with Weather Underground's API and
present current condition, current weather alerts, hurricanes, and ten day forecasts.

To run this program, you will need to install the requirements with the command
'pip install -r 'requirements.txt''. Then you can run the program with the command
'python weather.py'. You will also need to have an API key from Weather Underground set up in the environment that the program will be running from. I recommend setting
the key in your virtual environment by using the line 'export WUNDERGROUND_KEY=[your api key here]' in the .envrc file.

At this point you should be able to run the program with the command 'python weather.py'
